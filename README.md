# RTKX's Movies
## INTRO
Welcome to RTKX's Movies, a comprehensive collection of movies hosted on this site. We're excited to launch Version 1, featuring over 40 movies for your entertainment. This project is a labor of love, and I'm thrilled to share it with you. Whether you're a fan of action, comedy, drama, or romance, there's something for everyone in RTKX's Movies.

## ABOUT ME
I'm RTKX, a 14-year-old with a passion for hacking, gaming, and music. You might know me from my previous hacking endeavors, where I was known as the "GOAT Of Hacks" and the "#1 Plug For Hacks" in school. I've been involved in the hacking scene for a while, and I've released several popular hacks for games like Dogeminer2, Blooket, Gimkit, and Prodigy. I'm a fan of Hip-Hop and R&B, and you can often find me listening to artists like PARTYNEXTDOOR, Bryson Tiller, Tory Lanez, and The Weeknd. My love for music is only rivaled by my love for gaming and hacking.

## MY STORY
I previously went by the name R3A1TY, and I was infamous for releasing hacks for Dogeminer2, Blooket, Gimkit, and Prodigy. After a period of inactivity, I've returned with new projects, including RTKX's Movies, DogeMiner2 Hacks, and RTKX's Games. I've been working hard to create content that's both fun and useful, and I'm excited to share my new endeavors with you. I've got a new house, a new school, and a new perspective, and I'm ready to take on the world.

## HOW TO RUN THESE FILES
To run RTKX's Movies, you'll need to download the raw HTML file and host it on a platform like Google Sites. Please note that you must download the file and host it yourself, as we do not provide a direct link to the hosted site. This is to ensure that you have full control over the content and can customize it to your liking. To get started, simply download the HTML file, upload it to your Google Sites account, and you're good to go.

## LICENCE

* Credit RTKX as the original creator
* Not claim the project as your own or attempt to pass it off as your original work
* Not sell or distribute the project for profit without explicit permission from RTKX
 Failure to comply with these terms will result in the project being shut down. I'm proud of the work I've put into RTKX's Movies, and I want to ensure that it's used and shared responsibly.

* Over 40 movies in the initial release
